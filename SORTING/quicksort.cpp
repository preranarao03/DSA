/* QUICK SORT

   -> Quick sort is slightly better than mergesort because:
       (i). Time complexity = O(NlogN)
       (ii). Space complexity = O(1) (any additional data structure is not used to store data, unlike mergesort so quicksort is better)

    ->  First, you need to pick a pivot and place it in the correct position
    -> The pivot element can be:
       (i). 1st element in the array
       (ii). Last element in the array
       (iii). Median element in the array
       (iv). Random element in the array

    -> ex - consider array [4,6,2,5,7,9,1,3]
    -> let's consider the first element as the pivot here (4)
    -> smaller on the left and larger on the right

    (refer notebook for algo proper explanation)
