/* MERGESORT

-> mergesort refers to divide and merge

(refer notebook for diagram and explanation and code, the proper code is not given in the video)

-> we need to apply recursion and backtracking
-> in order to stop recursion a base case has to be written

TIME COMPLEXITY:

-> at every step, the array is getting divided by 2
-> the TC represents logarithmic pattern
-> O(N * log base 2 N)

SPACE COMPLEXITY:

-> an additional temp. array is being created during merge phase
-> thus, space complexity is O(N)
